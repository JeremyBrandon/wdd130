        <p>Hello, my name is Jeremy Brandon. I am a Pathways student who 
            has graduated from Pathways and started my journey into programming 
            and college. I am a father of two wonderfully challenging children: 
            Monty, age 1, and Felicity, age 3. I have been married to my wife 
            Kamber for six years now. I don't know how she managed to put up with 
            me for this long, but hopefully, there will be many more years to come. 
            I like to go off-roading, play video games (perhaps a bit too much), 
            and spend time with my wonderful family. I currently work for a mine 
            in Nevada as a haul truck operator. That's where we drive those Tonka-like 
            trucks the size of a two-story house. It's not too bad of a job. I also 
            took a class at Devmountain for web development and am really looking 
            forward to reusing that knowledge and building a firmer foundation in 
            programming. Yup, that's a little about myself.

        <p>I grew up near vegas and loved spending time in valley of fire. I like to look back at it to remember simpler times.</p>
